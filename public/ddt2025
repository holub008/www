 <h2>The 2025 Double Duluth Traverse</h2>
 <img src="/images/ddt2021.jpg" height="400px" />
 <p>
   As noted intellectual Ryan Lochte <a href="https://youtu.be/UnceMoPtVfE?si=qYuPmXTP4y3Sptom&t=197">once proclaimed</a>, "If you're a man at night, you gotta be a man in the morning."
   All CRUSHERS are invited to prove their man- and womanliness the morning after <a href="/wedding">Karl and Molly&apos;s wedding</a> by participating
   in the 2nd edition of the Double Duluth Traverse.
 </p>
 <h3>History</h3>
 <p>
   In <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/5913000070">September 2021</a>, Karl, Tyler, Nate, Nate, and Bjorn rolled out of Lester Park at 7AM. Over the course of 50-70 brutal miles of green circle riding,
   all the boys dropped before returning to Lester. A stripped crank arm, vomiting, popped tube (ðŸ™„), low morale, and childcare prevented them from completing the DDT. To this day, it's unclear if any of them <i>really</i> came back.
 </p>
 <h3>What is this?</h3>
 <p>
   A fun mountain bike group ride where the goal is to get as many people to complete as many miles as possible.
   Achieving an actual DDT finisher this go around would be awesome too. Ideally we're able to stick together for at least
   the first DT to make it more fun and support each other.
 </p>
 <p>
   If you want to come out and just ride the first DT, or only a part of the DT, great! We'd love to have you along for as many miles as you can make it.
 </p>
 <h3>Course</h3>
 <p>
    Entirely on the Duluth Traverse, start from Lester Park, hit Chamber Groves park, and lap back to Lester. The current DT (one direction) is 43 miles with 3K feet of climbing, <a href="https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7021011/duluth-traverse-dt">map here</a>.
    With only a few rocky sections, it's nontechnical riding that would be fine on any XC-style mountain bike. COGGS is constantly adding new sections to the DT, so this is subject to change, we'll
    ride whatever is available on August 24th!
 </p>
 <h3>Location and Schedule</h3>
 <p>
 Meet at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/uzgxw7L27MxzpFQJ6">Lester Park</a> trailhead on Sunday August 24th.
 <ul>
   <li><b>7:00AM:</b> Registration Opens</li>
   <li><b>7:01AM:</b> Neutral roll out</li>
   <li><b>8:02PM:</b> Projected sunset</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
   We are weather dependent, in the event of rain we'll either cancel or do a gravel adventure.
 </p>
 <h3>Logistics</h3>
 <p>
   There are few self-support options along the course. Karl will set up a couple drop spots with swedish fish, pickles, and
   spiked watermelon along the course, but largely you should pack food and water for yourself. Water and bathrooms are available on-trail at Hartley, Spirit, and
   Chambers Grove Park (around miles 10, 30, 45, 60, and 75).
 </p>
 <p>
   Bring tools to support yourself, and in the event of a mechanical catastrophe, we'll have bail out rides available to pick you up.
 </p>
 <p>
   If your body or soul fails you, it's typically easy to:
   <ul>
     <li>Descend the hill towards the lake on whatever trail or road is closest</li>
     <li>Jump onto the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/minnesota/dwp-trail">DWP</a> or Munger trail, <a href="https://www.crosscitytrailduluth.com/">Cross City Trail</a>, or <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/minnesota/lake-walk">Lake Walk</a> and ride north back to Lester Park on flat, smooth surface.
   </ul>
 </p>
