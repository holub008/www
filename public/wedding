     <h3>Schedule</h3>
     <p>
       <ul>
         <li><b>4:00 - 4:30PM</b> Wedding ceremony located along Amity Creek</li>
         <li><b>4:30 - 8:00PM</b> BBQ food truck in the parking lot</li>

     </p>
     <h3>What to bring</h3>
     <h4>BYOC</h4>
     <p>
       This is a <b>Bring Your Own Chair</b> event! Please bring a lawn chair or picnic blanket for the ceremony and relaxing throughout the day.
       We'll have some seating available for out-of-staters and forgetful people.
     </p>
     <h4>Attire</h4>
     <p>
        Whatever you'd like, though we'd recommend at most "active formal wear". Wear something comfortable & safe for a walk,
        playing lawn games, rollicking on the playground and in the creek with kids, etc.
     </p>
     <p>For reference, Karl is probably going to change into swimming trunks after the ceremony.</p>
     <h4>Weather contingency</h4>
     <p>
        Shelter will be relatively limited, meaning you should pack a rain jacket or umbrella in the event of a cloudy forecast.
        If it's truly miserable outside, we will move indoors to the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XoXsz4w1AVF59yDV7">Lester Amity Chalet</a>.
     </p>
     <h3>Activities</h3>
     <p>
       Molly and I are in love... with Lester Park! Some of the things you might enjoy doing here:
       <ul>
         <li>Hike to our favorite waterfalls, both of which have swimming holes:</li>
         <ul>
           <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/6zgaj6tJfZe3Fhge8">The Deeps</a></li>
           <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XneN1uX2bLVMHyiW6">Lester Falls</a></li>
         </ul>
         <li>Follow the paved Lake Walk down to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WJiv2oMvCjFXLWdv5">Brighton Beach</a>
         <li>Bring your bike and climb the mixed surface hill up to the <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/15216307">Hawk Ridge overlook</a>
         <ul>
           <li>Molly climbed this hill 35 times in one summer!</li>
         </ul>
         <li>Stick around on Sunday and mountain bike the <a href="/ddt2025">2nd Edition of the Double Duluth Traverse</a> with us.</li>
       </ul>
     </p>
     <p>
       We'd also love it if you brought games and other activities to share with others. There is a large, flat grass field available to us.
     </p>
     <h3>Parking</h3>
     <p>
       In the event of a full parking lot, parking is available anywhere in the residential areas west of Occidental Boulevard / 61st Ave. Duluth unfortunately follows alternate side parking, make
       sure to park on the odd side of the street on August 23<sup>rd</sup>!
