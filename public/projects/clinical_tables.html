<h2>The Structure of Tabular Data in Clinical Comparative Literature</h2>
<p>
  A static publication of these findings are available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.2196/33124">https://doi.org/10.2196/33124</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Below is a hierarchical presentation of underlying data. Explore classes of table attributes by clicking on radial slices.
  For example, to review which publications report any Continuous Outcome, I would click the slice "Continuous Outcomes" under
  "Statistic Format". More complex questions, like "which studies reported both continuous outcomes and reported units in the header?",
  I would click "Continuous Outcomes" and "In Header". Clicking an entry of the side menu provides detailed view of any matching
  record.
